      How to use
    
  </h1>

  
<p>Here you'll find how to use sIFR on your website. If you are wondering about interacting with the JavaScript, please see <a class="existingWikiWord" href="../show/Javascript+Implementation">Javascript Implementation</a>.</p>

<h2>Designing your site</h2>

<p>Design your site as normal, and make sure your headlines are styled
with CSS. Users who do not have the Flash player or have Javascript
disabled will see these CSS-styled headlines, so it is important to get
things looking the way you want before beginning to add sIFR.</p>

<h3>What you should use sIFR for</h3>

<p>sIFR is intended for headlines. While it is possible to use sIFR to
replace other elements, such as paragraphs or list items, this is not
recommended. Please also be careful with replacing links: browsers
treat links in Flash movies differently than normal HTML links, so you
may hurt usability if you use sIFR to replace links.</p>

<h2>Exporting the Flash file</h2>

<p>The second step is to export the Flash (.swf) file that will generate your new typeface.</p>

<p>To begin with, ensure that both the <code>customize_me.as</code> (see <a class="existingWikiWord" href="../show/Protecting+Commercial+Fonts">Protecting Commercial Fonts</a>) and <code>dont_customize_me.as</code> files are in the same folder as the <code>sifr.fla</code>

file. You do not need to upload any of these three files to your
server, but they must all be in the same folder when you export your <code>.swf</code> file.</p>

<p>To export your new typeface, open the <code>sifr.fla</code> file
which is included with the download, and double-click the invisible
textbox in the middle of the stage. If the "Properties" palette is not
already visible, open it by selecting "Window &gt; Properties", and
select which font you'd like to use from the drop down menu.
If you select a TrueType font, you can also create bold and italic
styles for your font by clicking on the "I" or "B" buttons.</p>

<p>To export the new file, choose "File &gt; Export" and save as <code>fontname.swf</code></p>

<p>The standard <code>sifr.fla</code> file contains most of the English
characters you will generally need. If you need to embed additional
characters or languages, click the "Character" button and select more
characters from there and re-export.</p>

<h2>Applying CSS print styles</h2>

<p>Copy and paste (or even better: learn and apply) the CSS rules found in the <code>sIFR-print.css</code>
file to your own print style sheet. These ensure that your original
headline styling will be printed, rather than the Flash replacements.</p>

<h2>Applying CSS screen styles</h2>

<p>Apply the styles in the <code>sIFR-screen.css</code> file into your
own screen style sheet. These are the styles which will be applied by
the Javascript if Flash is found to be present on the user's browser.</p>

<h2>Including the magic Javascript</h2>

<p>You must call the <code>sifr.js</code> script on any page that will be replacing headlines. The following line in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> should do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="sifr.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Configuring sIFR</h2>

<p>There are some settings you can change which alter the behaviour of
sIFR. These settings are all booleans, which means they can be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Here they are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sIFR.bAutoInit</code>: Initialize sIFR on load.</li>
<li><code>sIFR.bFixFragIdBug</code>: Determines whether the <a class="existingWikiWord" href="../show/Fragment+Identifier+Bug">Fragment Identifier Bug</a> will be fixed or not.</li>
<li><p><code>sIFR.bIsDisabled</code>: Determines whether sIFR will work or not.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sIFR.bHideBrowserText</code>: Determines whether sIFR will hide the text you want to replace or not.</p>

<p>By default sIFR will hide the text you want to replace while the
page is loading. If you want to, you can change this behavior so sIFR
will hide the text when the elements are actually replaced. To do this
open <code>sifr.js</code> and add <code>sIFR.bHideBrowserText = false;</code> before <code>sIFR.setup();</code>.</p>

<p>(Actually sIFR sets the sIFR-hasFlash class, and CSS rules you
specify, to control the hiding of the text. What this option really
does is wait before
setting the class.) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>An example of how you configure these settings:</p>

<pre><code>if(typeof sIFR == "function"){
    sIFR.bHideBrowserText = false;
    sIFR.bFixFragIdBug = false; // not recommended!
    sIFR.setup();
};
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to enable/disable sIFR for a specific browser, you can
use the UA object as described below and you'll have to edit the
following code in <code>sifr.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if(typeof sIFR == "function" &amp;&amp; !sIFR.UA.bIsIEMac){
    sIFR.setup();
};
</code></pre>

<p>In this example sIFR is disabled for IE/Mac. Remove the <code>&amp;&amp; !sIFR.UA.bIsIEMac</code> part to enable it again. You can also add other browsers here.</p>

<h2>Adding replace statements</h2>

<p>This step involves adding the (JavaScript) replace statements into
the mix. These are the heart and soul of the script and are used to
ensure the correct headlines are replaced, and in the way you want.
They can be added in the <code>sifr.js</code> file, or at the end of your (X)HTML file.</p>

<p>If you put the replace statements in the JavaScript file, they'll be executed on onload <strong>or</strong> when you call <code>sIFR()</code>. If you put the replace statements in the body, they'll be executed immediately.</p>

<p>Effectively, this means that you could put the replacement code in the JavaScript and call <code>sIFR()</code> in the body. It won't make any difference.</p>

<p>The reason there are two methods to replace elements in sIFR is that
the onload event is only fired when the page has fully loaded -
including all images and other external files. This can take much
longer than the actual rendering of the page, so replacing inside the
body will make the replacement begin earlier, and thus sIFR looks to
render faster.</p>

<p>To save bandwidth you can put the replace statements in the JavaScript file, and then call <code>sIFR()</code> in the body. The exact code you have to use in the body in this case is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

if(typeof sIFR == "function"){
    sIFR();
};
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can find more info in <a href="http://novemberborn.net/sifr/where-to-replace">Where to Replace</a>.</p>

<h2>Replacement Syntax</h2>

<p>To replace the fonts you call <code>sIFR.replaceElement</code>. This method takes the following arguments, in this specific order:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sSelector</code>: This is the CSS selector you use to select the elements you want to replace. The supported CSS selectors are <code>#</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>.</code>. Whitespace is used to select descendants. Please use whitespace only for this, so instead of <code>#foo &gt; p</code> use <code>#foo&gt;p</code>. You can use multiple selectors by seperating them with a comma ("<code>,</code>").</li>

<li><code>sFlashSrc</code>: location of the Flash movie. You might need to use a relative (<code>./movie.swf</code>) or absolute (<code>/movie.swf</code>) here.</li>
<li><code>sColor</code>: Text color. All colors are in hex notation (<code>#000000</code>).</li>
<li><code>sLinkColor</code>: Text color for links.</li>
<li><code>sHoverColor</code>: Color for hovered links.</li>

<li><code>sBgColor</code>: Background color.</li>
<li><p><code>nPaddingTop</code>, <code>nPaddingRight</code>, <code>nPaddingBottom</code>, <code>nPaddingLeft</code>:
if you use padding in the elements you want to replace, you have to set
the amount of padding here (in pixels, but without the <code>px</code> part).</p></li>
<li><p><code>sFlashVars</code>: extra variables you want to pass on to the Flash. These variables are seperated by <code>&amp;</code>. You can use:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>textalign=center</code>: Center text horizontally</li>
<li><code>offsetLeft=5</code>: Pushes text 5px to the right. Of course you can use any number here.</li>
<li><code>offsetTop=5</code>: Pushes text 5px down.</li>
<li><code>underline=true</code>: Adds underline to links on hover</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>sCase</code>: Use <code>upper</code> to transform the text to upper-case, use <code>lower</code>

to transform the text to lower-case. Depending on the browser this
might give problems when you want to change the casing of special
characters.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sWmode</code>: Set this argument to <code>transparent</code> if you want to use a transparent background. If you want to stack elements above the Flash movies, you need to set it to <code>opaque</code>. Mozilla browsers can have some difficulty rendering Flash movies with the <code>wmode</code> set. Therefore setting this is <strong>not recommended</strong>.</p>

<p>Transparency is not supported in Opera 7.x, Safari &lt; 1.2 &amp;

Flash 6, in Linux, and in very old (pre 1.0) Mozilla versions. In these
browsers sIFR will fall back to the background color instead of using
transparency.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You are advised to use <a href="http://novemberborn.net/sifr/named-arguments">named arguments</a> instead of placing the arguments in the correct order. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>if(typeof sIFR == "function"){
    sIFR.replaceElement("h1", named({sFlashSrc: "./vandenkeere.swf", sColor: "#000", sCase: "upper"}));
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Tuning your fonts</h2>

<p>The final step in implementing sIFR is to "tune" your fonts. As explained in "<a class="existingWikiWord" href="../show/What+is+sIFR">What is sIFR</a>"
sIFR works by measuring the size of the element you are replacing, and
then generating the Flash text at a size that matches it. This is a
fairly straightforward process, however, when, for example, your sIFR
font has a different character width or letter spacing than the font
used on the website, the scaling can cause the sIFR text to look really
awkward. This can be solved by changing the size of the elements just
before they are replaced.</p>

<p>When sIFR detects the right Flash version it sets a CSS class on the <code>html</code> element. Now, let's say you are only replacing <code>h1</code>'s. If you want to create a specific style for those elements to change their sizes, you have use the following CSS rule:</p>

<pre><code>.sIFR-hasFlash h1 {
    visibility: hidden;
    /* other CSS properties go here */
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is what we will call your <em>decoy style</em>. It will never be seen by users (because of <code>visibility: hidden</code>) but it will fine-tune the text a split-second before it is replaced.</p>

<p>In order to fine-tune the text you need to play around with the <code>font-size</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code>, <code>line-height</code> and <code>height</code> CSS properties. </p>

<p>You can use the <code>debug</code> method to prepare your page for fine-tuning. In the <code>sifr.js</code> file comment out the <code>sIFR.setup()</code> line and add <code>sIFR.debug()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if(typeof sIFR == "function"){
    sIFR.setup();
};
</code></pre>

<p>Becomes:</p>

<pre><code>if(typeof sIFR == "function"){
    // sIFR.setup();
    sIFR.debug();
};
</code></pre>

<p>With sIFR in debugging mode <em>and</em> the decoy styles working
you can start tweaking the sizes. If you can't match it exactly, make
the browser text a bit narrower than the sIFR text. You will want to
also comment out the <code>visibility: hidden;</code> property.</p>

<p>If you want to test your changes you can run the following code in the address bar:</p>

<pre><code>javascript:sIFR.debug.replaceNow();
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a handy bookmarklet you can use: <a href="javascript:sIFR.debug.replaceNow();">sIFR: Replace now</a>. Add it to your favorites and run it to see the elements being replaced.</p>

<p>When you're done restore the <code>sifr.js</code> file so <code>sIFR.setup()</code> is called again and enable <code>visibility: hidden;</code> again.</p>

<h3>Helpful tips to keep in mind while tuning your fonts:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>If you're using relative sizing for your font values in your
regular CSS, the first thing you'll want to do is place pixel sizes
into the font-size values of your decoy styles. This will give you a
more level playing field. (Keep in mind that increasing and decreasing
the pixel size in the decoy style can also change the size of your sIFR
replacement text.) From there, you can begin tweaking the
letter-spacing and then the line-height. This order seems to work well.</p></li>
<li><p>If you've used more detailed descendant selectors in your style sheet, you'll want to change your decoy styles from this: <code>.sIFR-hasFlash h2</code> to something like <code>.sIFR-hasFlash #content h2</code> (or whatever mirrors your regular CSS selector). If you have a heading with a class on it, you can write a selector like: <code>.sIFR-hasFlash #content h2.separate</code>
without a problem. Don't be afraid to get specific where you need to.
If you don't do this, the values in your regular styles will override
the <code>.sIFR-hasFlash</code> decoy styles for the same declarations
since they will have greater specificity. For example, if you have
line-height in both selectors, and you don't write a decoy style with
higher specificity, the value of your regular descendant h* selector
will override the decoy style and you'll be stumped as to <em>why</em> the decoy isn't obeying.</p></li>

<li><p>If you have long headlines, watch where the line break happens
in the sIFR and try to match it in the decoy if possible. This is
usually done with
letter-spacing.</p></li>
<li><p>If you notice slight <em>page shifting or jumping</em> as you
switch from decoy to sIFR, this can mean that one style is taking up
more space vertically. Try adjusting your line-height to make them
match more closely. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><!-- Please leave this comment in. There appears to be a bug in Instiki which causes the markup not to be parsed without it. --></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the bottom of your page, in the actual JavaScript replacement
statements, the order they're entered can matter. In a page with an <code>h4</code>
styled as a callout (with borders, padding and margins) it was found
that Internet Explorer Mac was shifting the next heading, an <code>h3</code>, to the right about 30px. Changing the order of the replacements so that the <code>h4</code> was loaded before the <code>h3</code> fixed that little problem.</p></li>

<li><p>If, in your main CSS styles, you've written any values for <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code> or <code>letter-spacing</code>, you will definitely want to overwrite these values in your decoy styles using pure pixels. <strong>This will give you cross-browser consistency.</strong>
As always, browsers have different default values. These differences
(especially in line height) can be one of the causes of a heading that
is large in one browser and small in another. Placing a background
color behind the heading, temporarily, should allow you to measure the
amount of space taken in each browser and correct it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dealing with FlashBlock</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">FlashBlock extension</a> for Mozilla browsers will show the alternate text instead of the Flash headlines. This means you'll have to style <code>span.sIFR-alternate</code> to override the decoy styles. You can test this by installing FlashBlock, or by installing <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> and the <a href="http://novemberborn.net/sifr/greasemonkey/sifr-tools.user.js">sIFR Tools</a> script. Now, if you go to <code>Tools &gt; User Script Commands &gt; sIFR - Act like FlashBlock</code> you'll see the alternate text as FlashbBlock users see it.</p>

<h2>Marvelling at your beautiful headlines</h2>

<p>This is absolutely the easiest and most enjoyable step involved with sIFR. <a class="existingWikiWord" href="../show/Mark+Wubben">Mark Wubben</a> is known to view all new entries on <a href="http://ipod411.com/">iPod411.com</a> just because of their use of sIFR.</p>
