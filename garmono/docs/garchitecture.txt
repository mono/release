GAR Architecture

The GAR system is a similar system to the BSD ports collection.  It's
a mechanism for automating the compilation and installation of
third-party source code.  It appears in the form of a tree of
directories containing Makefiles and other ancillary bookkeeping files
(such as installation manifests and checksum lists).  

GAR is currently used by The LNX-BBC project, as well as the
<http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/garnome/ GARNOME> distribution of GNOME.


Of interest to people wishing to learn the GAR system is

this overview of the ports collection>.

= User's Perspective =

From the User's perspective, the GAR system may well be a tree of
carefully maintained source code, ready to compile.  The reality is
that the system automatically downloads and customizes third-party
source code archives.  It builds necessary dependencies in the right
order, and generally takes care of a lot of the work associated with
compiling and installing software.

== Building packages with the system ==

The GAR system provides seven basic targets for each package:

 * fetch 
 * checksum 
 * extract 
 * patch 
 * configure 
 * build 
 * install 

The user who is building a package will use the system by entering
your package's directory and running "make install" or "make
patch" (for example).

In the base GAR directory are a number of files that can mostly be
ignored.  The really interesting stuff is in the subdirectories.
There is one subdirectory for each category of package (shells,
editors, development, games, etc), and inside each category directory
is a directory for each package in that category.  Thus, the shells/
dir will have directories named bash/, tcsh/, zsh/, ash/, sash/, and
so on.

To build and install a bash, for example, you simply cd into
shells/bash/ and run "make install".  Couldn't be simpler, right?

== Configuring the GAR system ==

If you wish to configure the way the GAR system behaves, this is
usually done by editing the file
<http://cvs.lnx-bbc.org/cvs/gar/gar.conf.mk?rev=HEAD gar.conf.mk>,
which lives in the base GAR directory.  In here you'll see a number of
basic variables for things like the installation prefix, build prefix
(for things like header files that are used as part of the build
process but may not need to be installed), CFLAGS, a local file
repository, and master backup site for source downloads.

For most cases, only the main_DESTDIR and build_prefix variables will need
to be changed.  A full description of all the variables in this file
is in the <garvariables.html GAR Variables> document.

= Maintainer's Perspective =

== Basics ==

This section tends to lag behind the <gartips.html GAR Tips> and
<garvariables.html GAR Variables> documents, so be sure to read them
regularly!

From the package maintainer's perspective, the GAR system is a library
of make targets that can be configured by setting certain special
variables or overridden file-by-file.  To make a GAR package, you make
a directory for a package inside the directory representing its
category.  Inside this directory, you create a Makefile describing
your package.

=== An Example ===

The best way to understand the process of making a new package is to
look at an example:

----8<----
GARNAME = grep
GARVERSION = 2.4.2
CATEGORIES = utils
MASTER_SITES = ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/grep/
DISTFILES = $(DISTNAME).tar.gz 

DESCRIPTION = grep
define BLURB
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)
endef

CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/configure
BUILD_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
INSTALL_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile

CONFIGURE_ARGS = $(DIRPATHS)

include ../../gar.mk
----8<----

The first few lines set some basic bookkeeping info.  The GARNAME and
GARVERSION refer to the package name and version string as the GAR
system will manipulate them.  They are also used to create the
convenience variable DISTNAME, which defaults to
$(GARNAME)-$(GARVERSION) (since most GNU or automake-using packages
name their tarballs in that fashion).

The fetch target will, by default, try to grab
$(MASTER_SITES)$(DISTFILES) for each of the space-separated entries in
either variable.  

Next are some basic description variables.  The DESCRIPTION variable
should be a short, one-line description of the package, while the
BLURB is a longer multi-paragraph description.  This BLURB is taken
straight from the debian package for grep.

The actual build of the system depends on the CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS,
BUILD_SCRIPTS, and INSTALL_SCRIPTS variables.  These point to a
space-separated list of files that are essential to the configure,
build, and install steps (respectively).

The GAR system is pretty smart, and will know what to do with most
types of scripts.  It knows to just run CONFIGURE_SCRIPTs named
"configure", and to run "make" or "make install" in the
directory where a Makefile lives.  It also knows that Imakefiles
use xmkmf, and so forth.  For most packages, no special magic needs
to happen here.

We usually, however, need to specify the CONFIGURE_ARGS to include the
directory settings that we define in
<http://cvs.lnx-bbc.org/cvs/gar/gar.conf.mk?rev=HEAD gar.conf.mk>.
This currently requires setting it to include $(DIRPATHS).  This may,
in future, not be necessary for packages that use autoconf-generated
configure scripts.  Some older configure scripts don't accept all of
the standard directories, so the package maintainer must set them by
doing something like:

----8<----
NODIRPATHS += --bindir --sbindir --libexecdir --datadir --infodir 
NODIRPATHS += --sysconfdir --sharedstatedir --localstatedir --libdir 
NODIRPATHS += --includedir --mandir
----8<----

But this is uncommon.

Finally, we include the
<http://cvs.lnx-bbc.org/cvs/gar/gar.mk?rev=HEAD gar.mk> library.  This
takes all of the variable setting we've done and puts it to good use.
This allows your little teeny Makefile to provide the seven basic
targets described in the User Perspective section.  It must come last
(or, at least, after all of the variables have been set) in order to
function properly.

=== Dependencies ===

Often a package will require the presence of another in order to
compiler or run.  Most binary packaging systems require the user to
satisfy these dependencies manually.  GAR, on the other hand, attempts
to satisfy them automatically.

To specify that one gar package depends on another, there are three
basic variables (soon to become more):  DEPENDS, LIBDEPS, and
BUILDDDEPS.  The format of these variables is a space-separated list
of category/package tuples.  Thus, the parted package depends on
e2fsprogs-libs, and its Makefile contains the following line:

----8<----
LIBDEPS = lib/e2fsprogs-libs
----8<----

This tells GAR to go into ../../lib/e2fsprogs-libs and install that
package before proceeding with parted's configure step.

=== Checksum file ===

The package isn't complete until there is a checksum file.  Finish up
your Makefile, and then run "make fetch".  If all the files look
correct to you, run "make makesum" and check the resulting
"checksums" file into CVS alongside the Makefile.  This checksums file
will be consulted during the "make checksum" phase.

== When defaults aren't enough ==

Quite often, the default behavior isn't what one would hope.  You can
pass parameters to your configure script with CONFIGURE_ARGS, but what
if the GAR system doesn't know about your configuration script type?
What if the configuration steps aren't enough?  What if they're
flat-out wrong?  What if the same is true for the fetch, extract, or
install rules?

Fortunately, the system provides for this in a number of ways.  What
follows are a few of the mechanisms that a package maintainer can use
to override or enhance the default behaviors.

=== Overriding Variables ===

Sometimes, a package just doesn't treat your configuration information
the way you'd like.  Either it munges the parameters you pass too much
(or too little), or it just doesn't prompt you for certain variables.
Fortunately, we have the technology to set variables so that they will
keep our munged values. 

For a detailed description of this, read the "Override Make Vars"
<gartips.html GAR Tip>.

Here is an example package that uses this.  w3m's Makefile uses
non-standard directory variables internally, and does not allow you to
specify them via the configure script.  Thus, we do the following:

----8<----
BIN_DIR = $(bindir)
LIB_DIR = $(libdir)
HELP_DIR = $(docdir)

BUILD_ARGS = BIN_DIR="$(BIN_DIR)" LIB_DIR="$(LIB_DIR)" HELP_DIR="$(HELP_DIR)"
INSTALL_ARGS = BIN_DIR="$(BIN_DIR)" LIB_DIR="$(LIB_DIR)" HELP_DIR="$(HELP_DIR)"
----8<----

Note that the BUILD_ARGS line could also be written as:

----8<----
BUILD_OVERRIDE_DIRS = BIN_DIR LIB_DIR HELP_DIR
----8<----

Although the INSTALL_ARGS could not, due to the fact that
INSTALL_OVERRIDE_DIRS prepends $(DESTDIR), and the w3m package
/already/ honors $(DESTDIR)!

For more information on INSTALL_OVERRIDE_DIRS, see the "Install
Override Dirs" <gartips.html GAR Tip>.  For more information on
$(DESTDIR), see the "Implicit Destdir Considered Harmful"
<gartips.html GAR Tip>.

=== pre- and post- rules ===

For each of the seven basic targets, there exist slots for per-package
pre- and post- rules.  That means that the package maintainer can
specify work to be done immediately before or after a rule.

As an example, let's consider the util-linux package.  It doesn't use
a standard autoconf-style configure script, but it can be configured
by setting a variable at the top of the MCONFIG file.  Thus, the end
of our utils/util-linux/Makefile looks like the following:

----8<----
CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/configure
BUILD_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
INSTALL_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile

CONFIGURE_ARGS = $(DIRPATHS)

include ../../gar.mk

pre-configure:
        echo "DESTDIR=$(DESTDIR)" > $(WORKSRC)/MCONFIG.NEW
        cat $(WORKSRC)/MCONFIG >> $(WORKSRC)/MCONFIG.NEW
        mv $(WORKSRC)/MCONFIG.NEW $(WORKSRC)/MCONFIG
        $(MAKECOOKIE)
----8<----

Thus, before the configure script is run, the package-defined
pre-configure rule adds code setting DESTDIR to the $(prefix) variable
in MCONFIG.  For more information on $(DESTDIR), see the
"Implicit Destdir Considered Harmful <gartips.html GAR Tip>.

Note that we put the pre-configure after the include, as per
the "Rules After Include" <gartips.html GAR Tip>.  This ensures that
our rule won't be trumped by any rules in the included files.

As another example, the Bourne Again SHell (bash) can be linked to
with the name "sh" in order to cause it to behave (somewhat) like a
POSIX Bourne Shell.  Thus, the end of our shells/bash/Makefile looks
like:

----8<----
CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/configure
BUILD_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
INSTALL_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile

CONFIGURE_ARGS = $(DIRPATHS)

include ../../gar.mk

post-install:
        (cd $(DESTDIR)$(bindir); ln -sf bash sh)
        $(MAKECOOKIE)
----8<----

Thus creating the symbolic link to sh.

For more information on $(DESTDIR), see the "Implicit Destdir
Considered Harmful <gartips.html GAR Tip>.

=== Overriding default behavior ===

Sometimes it's not enough to merely enhance the behavior of a rule.
Sometimes the default handler for a given script is dead wrong, or the
script has no default handler.  In this case, it is easy enough to
provide your own handler.
 
For example, the Perl package has a file called configure.gnu that
needs to be run.  The GAR system doesn't know that it's just like a
standard configure script, so we have to tell it like so:

----8<----
CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/configure.gnu
BUILD_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
INSTALL_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile

NODIRPATHS += --exec_prefix --bindir --sbindir --libexecdir \
  --datadir --infodir --sysconfdir --sharedstatedir         \
  --localstatedir --libdir --includedir --mandir

CONFIGURE_ARGS = $(DIRPATHS)

include ../../gar.mk

configure-$(WORKSRC)/configure.gnu:
        cd $(WORKSRC) && $(CONFIGURE_ENV) ./configure.gnu $(CONFIGURE_ARGS)
        $(MAKECOOKIE)
----8<----

The custom configure target should perform the same steps that a user
would at the command line, with appropriate changing of directories
and setting of environment variables.  In this case, we do exactly
what happens in the standard library routine for configure scripts,
but we use configure.gnu instead of simply configure.  Notice that we
put CONFIGURE_ENV in even though we don't use it, in order to be
consistent with the standard library routines.

At the end, we run $(MAKECOOKIE) to signify that this step is
complete.  This lets GAR know where to pick up where it left off if
the build only gets partway through.

=== Putting the two together ====

The following example is from the net-tools package, which has a
bizarre interactive configuration system.  The maintainer automated
this by setting some variables at the top of the package's Makefile
and then piping the output of the "yes" program into the configurator
in order to accept all defaults.

----8<----
CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
BUILD_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
INSTALL_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile

include ../../gar.mk

pre-configure:
        echo "BASEDIR=$(prefix)" > $(WORKSRC)/Makefile.NEW
        cat $(WORKSRC)/Makefile >> $(WORKSRC)/Makefile.NEW
        mv $(WORKSRC)/Makefile.NEW $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
        $(MAKECOOKIE)

configure-$(WORKSRC)/Makefile:
        # if you want non-default answers to the "make config"
        # questions, you'll have to go through and answer the
        # questions the way you want, and then preserve the
        # resulting file (instead of the action below, which
        # simply uses the defaults every time)
        yes '' | make -C $(WORKSRC) config
        $(MAKECOOKIE)
----8<----

=== Patching ===

Sometimes the system simply won't build from pristine upstream
sources, no matter how much fiddling you do in pre- and post- rules.
For instances like these, we provide patches with our packages.  

The easiest way to make a patch is to have gar do it for you.  Run
"make extract" and then go make your changes in work/. Once you're
done making changes, run "make makepatch".  This will create a file
named "gar-base.diff" in the files/ directory, representing all the
differences between the upstream sources and your modified tree.

Add this file to the PATCHFILES variable in your Makefile (e.g.,
"PATCHFILES = gar-base.diff") and verify the effectiveness and integrity
of your patch.  Then run "make makesum" to update the checksums file.
Don't forget to commit all three files (Makefile, checksums, and
files/gar-base.diff) into CVS.

In addition, the system will download any third-party patches listed
in PATCHFILES from the list of MASTER_SITES if it can't find them on
the local system.  It is legitimate to have more than one patch
file; some of our packages have several.


Here's the util-linux package again as an example.  We made the file
<http://cvs.lnx-bbc.org/cvs/gar/utils/util-linux/files/no-chown.patch?rev=1.1
utils/util-linux/files/no-chown.patch> as a patch to the original
sources.  Then in our Makefile we put:

----8<----
PATCHFILES = no-chown.patch
----8<----

=== Providing nonexistent behavior ===

Suppose you want to perform a configure step, but there is no actual
program or script associated with the step of configuration.  You
could conceivably want to run a series of shell commands to create a
configuration file.  Since there is no actual script to run, you would
specify "custom" as the CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS.

For example, look at the way the tracesroute package performs its
build step.  There was no makefile, so the maintainer had to provide a
method for the compilation commands to be run semi-manually.  Thus,
the BUILD_SCRIPTS is set to "custom", and a build-custom target is
created.

----8<----
WORKSRC = $(WORKDIR)

BUILD_SCRIPTS = custom

include ../../gar.mk

build-custom:
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(WORKSRC)/tracesroute $(WORKSRC)/traceroute.c -lresolv -lm
        $(MAKECOOKIE)
----8<----

It is worth noting that WORKSRC is set to WORKDIR because the .c file
is extracted via extraordinary means.

It is the opinion of the GAR authors that any package supplying a
-custom rule should properly provide a generalized rule for inclusion in
the <http://cvs.lnx-bbc.org/cvs/gar/gar.lib.mk?rev=HEAD gar.lib.mk>
file.  It may or may not be useful; however, for there to be a
generalized default rule that turns .c files into executables.

=== Manifest-based installs ===

One of the most common occasions where a package maintainer would like
to use a -custom rule is when installing software that has no built-in
installation mechanism.  Moving files from location to location is
common enough that GAR provides a general mechanism for this.

A package maintainer can specify the locations, permissions, and modes
of a file (or collection of files) in a file called manifest.  This
file contains a list of installation tuples (one per line) of the
following format:

----8<----
source:destination[:mode[:owner[:group]]]
----8<----

An installation tuple may use shell variables taken from the GAR
environment, but must enclose them in curly braces instead of
parentheses.  Thus, a sample manifest file may contain the following:

----8<----
${WORKSRC}/nwall:${DESTDIR}${bindir}/nwall:2755:root:tty
${WORKSRC}/src/foo:${DESTDIR}${sharedstatedir}/foo
${WORKSRC}/yoink:${DESTDIR}${sysconfdir}/yoink:0600
----8<----

Note that all options after the destination location for the file are
optional, but one must provide all preceeding options in order to
define a given optional field.  Thus to specify the owner of a file,
one must also specify the mode.

For more information on $(DESTDIR), see the "Implicit Destdir
Considered Harmful" <gartips.html GAR Tip>.

= Building Your Own Package =

This section will lead you through an example of package creation,
using the GNU hello program.  Since this program is increidbly
well-behaved, it won't require many of the features listed in the
previous chapter.

== The Template ==

In the base gar directory is a file called pkg-template.mk.  This
contains a quick form to fill out in order to get started.  Make a
directory for your package and copy pkg-template.mk to Makefile in
your package's directory.

----8<----
$ mkdir utils/hello
$ cp pkg-template.mk utils/hello/Makefile
$ cd utils/hello
----8<----

Begin by taking responsibility for your package, editing the Makefile
and filling out the MAINTAINER variable with your e-mail address.

	[The example e-mail address is a spam trap, and will list any
	mails sent to it with the vipul's razor spam registry.  One of
	the BBC developers, Seth Schoen, notes that his last name is
	German for "beautiful", and so set up a spam trap using the
	German word for "ugly".]

----8<----
MAINTAINER = J. Random Hacker <haesslich@zork.net>
----8<----


For aesthetic purposes, get rid of the pre-install rule at the bottom
of the file, and set the CATEGORIES.

----8<----
CATEGORIES = utils
----8<----

== Fetch ==

Our first step is to make sure the source archives can be fetched
successfully.  The key elements here are the MASTER_SITES and
DISTFILES.  The first step is to hunt around and find the upstream
source archive.

GNU hello is, like all GNU projects, released officially on the
<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/> site.  A quick search finds the
<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/> directory, and the most recent version up
at the <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz> URL.

Looking at this URL we must dissect it into two parts, the filename
and the directory URL part.  The directory URL (including the trailing
slash) goes into MASTER_SITES, and the filename goes into DISTFILES.

----8<----
MASTER_SITES = ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/
DISTFILES = $(GARNAME)-$(GARVERSION).tar.gz
----8<----

Now that DISTFILES looks like it fits the pattern of the filename, so
it's now up to us to fill in those two portions.

----8<----
GARNAME = hello
GARVERSION = 2.1.1
----8<----

To test this, we now run "make fetch".

----8<----
$ make fetch
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
install -d download
 ==> Grabbing download/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz

	[fetch] complete for hello.
----8<----

Don't worry about those Error 1 lines.  They're saying that GAR didn't
find the file to be fetched in any already-downloaded locations.  The
system will try local dirs first, then on to the upstream site, and
finally to our haphazardly-maintained archive of packages we've
grabbed.

We now check the tarball that's in the download/ dir to make sure it's
what we wanted, and move on to the next step.

== Checksum ==

Once we're certain that we have our file locations worked out, we can
make a set of md5 signatures.  To do so, just run "make makesum".

----8<----
$ make makesum
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
	[fetch] complete for hello.
Checksums made for download/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz 
----8<----

Now you'll notice a file called "checksums" containing md5 signatures
for all the DISTFILES.

----8<----
$ ls
Makefile  checksums  download/
$ cat checksums 
70c9ccf9fac07f762c24f2df2290784d  download/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz
----8<----

Now when we run "make checksum", we see that the checksums match and
the file validates.

----8<----
$ make checksum
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
	[fetch] complete for hello.
install -d cookies
 ==> Running checksum on hello-2.1.1.tar.gz
70c9ccf9fac07f762c24f2df2290784d  download/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz
file hello-2.1.1.tar.gz passes checksum test!
	[checksum] complete for hello.
----8<----

== Extract ==

Since hello-2.1.1.tar.gz is a gzipped tarball, we can just let GAR
figure out how to handle extraction.  We run "make extract", and let
the system unpack.

----8<----
$ make extract
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
	[fetch] complete for hello.
	[checksum] complete for hello.
install -d work
 ==> Extracting download/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz
	[extract] complete for hello.
----8<----

Now our tarball has been unpacked into the work/ subdirectory.

----8<----
$ ls
Makefile  checksums  cookies/  download/  work/
$ ls work

$ ls work/hello-2.1.1/

== Patch ==

Patching is a last-resort technique, as far as GAR packaging is
concerned.  It's finnicky, causes problems when upstream upgrades
occur, and generally is kept around as a last resort.  Of all the
situations where a developer feels the need to patch, perhaps one in
ten is a legitimate reason to patch.  The <gartips.html Gar Tips>
file contains a list of techniques for avoiding patching, but here are
a few in the context of how to avoid patching:

Override Make Vars:
	Perhaps you're patching a Makefile or Makefile.in to set some
	variable.  Look up the Override Make Vars <gartips.html Gar
	Tip> for a better way to set that variable that won't involve
	a patch.

Concatenation:
	Most programming or scripting languages are procedural, and
	events that come later in a file will adjust the state set up
	by commands that came earlier.  If you're looking to adjust
	some state, consider using "echo command >>
	$(WORKSRC)/some-source-file" in a pre- or post-configure rule
	to add a command that comes LAST in the source file or script
	that does what you want.  Most often this has the effect of
	overriding the existing behavior, and it is resistant to
	change in upstream source files.

That said, if you're still interested in patches, look at the "make
makepatch" command, and check out the PATCHFILES variable.

== Configure ==

The key to configuration is the CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS variable.  As this
is a GNU package, it uses GNU Autoconf to configure the source tree
for compilation.  This is the most common format that we find source
code packages, and it is nearly a Unix-wide standard now.

----8<----
CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/configure
CONFIGURE_ARGS = $(DIRPATHS)
----8<----

These defaults (which came with the pkg-template.mk) should work just
fine.  $(DIRPATHS) contains a set of configure arguments that set the
directories where we want the package's files to ultimately live.  We
run them, and get the following:

----8<----
$ make configure
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
	[fetch] complete for hello.
	[checksum] complete for hello.
	[extract] complete for hello.
	[patch] complete for hello.
 ==> Running configure in work/hello-2.1.1
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes

----8<----

...lots of checks follow, leading ultimately to...

== Build ==

Since GNU hello uses Autoconf and Automake, we get a standard Makefile
for building and installing.  Again, the default is good enough for
us.

----8<----
BUILD_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
----8<----

So we run "make build" and get a lot of compilation output:

----8<----
$ make build
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
	[fetch] complete for hello.
	[checksum] complete for hello.
	[extract] complete for hello.
	[patch] complete for hello.
	[configure] complete for hello.
 ==> Running make in work/hello-2.1.1
make[1]: Entering directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1'
make  all-recursive
make[2]: Entering directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1'
Making all in contrib
----8<----

culminating in the magic message

----8<----
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1'
	[build] complete for hello.
----8<----

== Install ==

Since the GNU hello Makefile also handles installation just the way we
like, using $(DESTDIR) as an installation superprefix for the standard
dirs, we can also accept the default:

----8<----
INSTALL_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
----8<----

Thus, running "make install" gives us more voluminous output.

----8<----
$ make install
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
	[fetch] complete for hello.
	[checksum] complete for hello.
	[extract] complete for hello.
	[patch] complete for hello.
	[configure] complete for hello.
	[build] complete for hello.
 ==> Running make install in work/hello-2.1.1
make[1]: Entering directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1'
Making install in contrib
make[2]: Entering directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1/contrib'
make[3]: Entering directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1/contrib'
----8<----

...ending with the magical message...


----8<----
make[3]: Leaving directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1'
make[2]: Leaving directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1'
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1'
	[install] complete for hello.
----8<----

Now is the time to check that everything was installed properly in
your $(DESTDIR).  The true test of this is to see if your "make
tarball" works right.

----8<----
$ make tarball
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
	[fetch] complete for hello.
	[checksum] complete for hello.
	[extract] complete for hello.
	[patch] complete for hello.
	[configure] complete for hello.
	[build] complete for hello.
rm -rf cookies/install*
make DESTDIR=/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/tmp
BUILD_PREFIX=/../../../../../../..//../../../home/nick/built/ install
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello'
[===== NOW BUILDING:	hello-2.1.1	=====]
	[fetch] complete for hello.
	[checksum] complete for hello.
	[extract] complete for hello.
	[patch] complete for hello.
	[configure] complete for hello.
	[build] complete for hello.
----8<----

As you can see, the tarball rule does some feints before actually
building a tarball for your package.  First it does a normal build,
but then it plays a few games with cookie dirs, and that's when things
can get wonky.  Eventually it does its install into a tmp dir, and
then builds the tarball:

----8<----
	[install] complete for hello.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello'
find tmp -depth -type d | while read i; do rmdir $i > /dev/null 2>&1
|| true; done
tar czvf
/home/nick/bbc/gar/utils/hello/work/hello-2.1.1-install.tar.gz -C tmp
../
./bin/
./bin/hello
./share/
----8<----

This goes on for every file it has installed, ending up with

----8<----
./share/locale/uk/LC_MESSAGES/
./share/locale/uk/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo
mkdir -p cookies/. && date >> cookies/tarball
----8<----

Now we should see a tarball in work/ with the word "install" in the
filename.

----8<----
$ ls
Makefile  checksums  cookies/  download/  tmp/  work/
$ ls work/
hello-2.1.1/  hello-2.1.1-install.tar.gz
----8<----

Now we can check our tarball to see if it has what we want


----8<----
$ tar tvzf work/hello-2.1.1-install.tar.gz | head -30
drwxr-xr-x nick/nick         0 2002-09-15 23:23:14 ./
drwxr-xr-x nick/nick         0 2002-09-15 23:23:13 ./bin/
-rwxr-xr-x nick/nick     11095 2002-09-15 23:23:13 ./bin/hello
drwxr-xr-x nick/nick         0 2002-09-15 23:23:13 ./share/
drwxrwxr-x nick/nick         0 2002-09-15 23:23:12 ./share/locale/
drwxrwxr-x nick/nick         0 2002-09-15 23:23:10 ./share/locale/ca/
----8<----

(lots more output follows)

Or we can inspect the tmp/ dir to see what was installed by the package.

----8<----
$ tree tmp/
tmp/
|-- bin
|   `-- hello
`-- share
    `-- locale
        |-- ca
        |   `-- LC_MESSAGES
        |       `-- hello.mo
        |-- da
        |   `-- LC_MESSAGES
        |       `-- hello.mo
----8<----

(lots more follows)

----8<----
        |-- tr
        |   `-- LC_MESSAGES
        |       `-- hello.mo
        `-- uk
            `-- LC_MESSAGES
                `-- hello.mo

== Our final Makefile ==

Our final utils/hello/Makefile looks like so


----8<----
GARNAME = hello
GARVERSION = 2.1.1
CATEGORIES = utils
MASTER_SITES = ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/
DISTFILES = $(GARNAME)-$(GARVERSION).tar.gz
MAINTAINER = J. Random Hacker <haesslich@zork.net>

DESCRIPTION = The classic greeting, and a good example 
define BLURB
  The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.
  It allows nonprogrammers to use a classic computer science tool
  which would otherwise be unavailable to them.

  In all seriousness, this is an example of how to do a GAR
  package.  It is the GAR version of the GNU Project's `hello
  world' program (which is itself an example for the GNU 
  Project).
endef

CONFIGURE_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/configure
BUILD_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile
INSTALL_SCRIPTS = $(WORKSRC)/Makefile

CONFIGURE_ARGS = $(DIRPATHS)

include ../../gar.mk
----8<----

We then add the Makefile and checksums files to CVS, check our work
in, and we are done packaging GNU hello!

= Hacker's Perspective =

== gar.conf.mk ==

The <http://cvs.lnx-bbc.org/cvs/gar/gar.conf.mk?rev=HEAD gar.conf.mk>
file is where all of the user configuration goes on.  Setting dir
paths, compiler flags, download locations, etc all happens here.  

== gar.mk ==

The <http://cvs.lnx-bbc.org/cvs/gar/gar.mk?rev=HEAD gar.mk> file is
where the seven basic rules are defined, and the dependency structure
is created.  All of the commands that a user might type in as make
targets are here.

== gar.lib.mk ==


This file is where all of the rules describing the nitty-gritty of how
to handle particular scripts happens.  This is where the actual code
to compile a list of URLs and attempt to download from each occurs.
This is where the rules for deciding how to build with a Makefile,
install with a manifest, or configure with a configure script are
defined.  Most of the real hacking on GAR goes on in
<http://cvs.lnx-bbc.org/cvs/gar/gar.lib.mk?rev=HEAD gar.lib.mk>!
