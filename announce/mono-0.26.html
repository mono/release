<h2>Mono 0.26 Release</h2>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>

	<p>A new release of the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> runtime and SDK is
	available for UNIX and Windows.  Packages for various
	distributions are also available from our download page.</p>

	<p>Since the last release, 1,591 individual commits were done to
	our runtime and class libraries (out of 2,700 commits to the
	repository).</p>

	<p>I know that the following summary is incomplete, I
	apologize for missing major features</p>

	<p>We continue our SourceGear <a
	href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=sourcegear">contract</a>,

<h2>2. New Features in this release.</h2>

	<p>Peter Williams authored our new unified build system (before
	we had two build paths: one for Unix and one for Windows), and
	Gonzalo helped with the roll-out.  Thanks to the two of them
	for assisting us in the migration.

	<p>The new build system supports profiles; Currently we support
	.NET 1.0, .NET 1.1 and the experimental Generics profile (for
	the Generics extensions).

	<p>Andreas Nahr continued his quest to fix the signatures,
	attributes and visibility in all of our class libraries.  Also
	he has been adding the proper AssemblyInfo files to all of our
	assemblies as well as adding Locale support.

<h3>Runtime</h3>

	<p>Thread pool management has been fixed to have the same
	semantics as .NET;  Lots of bugs have been fixed there.

	<p>Portability fixes, and progress on the Power PC port.  Chris
	and Mark have initiated a SPARC port of the JIT engine and
	Malte contributed fixes to the ARM port.

<h3>C# Compiler</h3>

	<p>Martin, Ravi and Miguel fixed the top 88 most wanted bugs in
	the C# compiler, needless to say, we are very proud of the
	reliability and conformance of our compiler.  

	<p>It was a fantastic compiler, now it is even better.  Thanks
	to everyone who contributed bug reports for MCS, keep them
	coming.

	<p>Also MCS has gone through a memory usage diet, and we have
	increased the performance on this release mostly by reducing
	the memory usage.  We did this by using Mono's integrated
	profiler.

	<p>Big outstanding bugs have been dealt with, and we are on a
	final pass to close the existing known problems before we jump
	into the anonymous methods and generics support.

<h3>Tools</h3>

	<p>Lluis contributed a new XSD tool based on the new
	XmlSerialization code.  This version is more complete than our
	old XSD.  It is now possible to create C# classes from a Xml
	Schema file and also create an XML schema out of a C# class

<h3>IL Assembler</h3>

	<p>Jackson got our IL assembler passing all of the Rotor tests,
	and also has added support for Generics.   

	<p>We used our assembler to test our runtime engine generics
	support.  

<h3>System.Net</h3>

	<p>Gonzalo added support for proxies as well as fixing plenty of
	bugs in NetworkStream, Socket and HttpWebRequest.

	<p>Jerome contributed the IPV6 support to Mono, which is only
	available if you build with the .NET 1.1 profile mode.

<h3>Web Services world</h3>

	<p>Lluis worked on adding support for server side ASP.NET web
	services, including complex parameters, in/out parameters,
	async calls, Soap headers and Soap extensions.

	<p>We also ship some nice examples in the XSP server that make
	use of the Web Services extension features (Dump, Encrypt and
	Trace samples included).

	<p>Gonzalo and Daniel made the mod_mono Apache module work with
	both 1.3 and 2.0 editions of Apache.  This version also uses a
	separate process to host Mono, so we get the right caching
	semantics.

	<p>Work on the various pieces of WSDL continues.

<h3>Web Forms</h3>

	<p>Plenty of updates to the ASP.NET to conform to the new
	features in .NET 1.1, as well as many controls from Gaurav to
	support the Mobile class libraries. 

	<p>Gonzalo and Lluis got the Web Services .asmx and .ashx files
	supported in our web hosting facilities (both XSP and Apache).

<h3>Xml Serialization</h3>

	<p>Lluis improved the XmlSerializer.  It now supports all
	attributes for customizing xml output.

	<p>Lluis implemented the XmlSchemaImporter and
	XmlCodeExporter. They also improved primitive type support in
	xml schema.

	<p>Atsushi and Lluis improved XmlSchema compilation support. It
	now supports more precise schema object information.

<h3>Windows.Forms and System.Drawing</h3>

<p>Alexandre Pigolkine and Aleksey Ryabchuk did most of the work on
System.Windows.Forms and System.Drawing.  Duncan and myself did
janitorial work on the code base.<p>

	<p>Bmp, Jpeg codecs improved, PngCodec added.

	<p>Xr implementation: It is possible to load an image, paint on it and save
	modified image to a file:  Currently 24bpp and 32bpp formats are supported.

	<p>Duncan and Larry Ewing (yes, that Larry Ewing) improved our
	Xr-based rendering engine, which continues to move along

	<p>Wine implementation improved to support image visualization.

	<p>MDI Forms work on Linux.

	<p>FileDialog is compatible with Wine, ColorDialog implemented. 
	The dialogs were not tested with WineLib package (looks like it does not support common dialogs).

	<p>Implementation of some controls (Button,Label,RadioButton,CheckBox) changed 
	to be compatible with documentation and to work with WineLib package.

	<p>Some bugs, revealed by samples at <a
	href="http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples">http://www.nullenvoid.com/mono/wiki/index.php/WineSamples</a>,
	are fixed.

	<p>Switched to WineLib by default.

<h3>XML support</h3>

	<p>The work to implement a fully managed version of Xslt
	(System.Xml.Xsl) is making enourmous progress.  The effort is
	being coordinated by Ben who has done an amazing job in
	implementing Xslt in record time.  Both Atsushi and Piers made
	very big contributions to the effort.

	<p>Monodoc is now capable of running completely with our managed
	implementation of Xslt.  This is good, because we will now be
	able to implement properly the XPathNavigator-based interfaces
	without having to resort to temporary files, and we also get
	the proper threading semantics.

	<p>Piers did an great job at fixing XPath as the work on Xstl
	progressed.  He also fixed the various bugs reported by the
	Dashboard hackers (Variable handling, improved namespace
	support, sorting support and so on).

	<p>Atsushi also got XPathDocument and its XPathNavigator
	implemented.  XmlDocument's XPathNavigator has been also
	improved and is a lot faster thanks to the new
	architecture. They are now almost finised. 

	<p>On the DTD support: XmlValidatingReader validatation, entity
	handling, ID and default attribute support in XmlDocument and
	XPathNavigator.

	<p>Improved well-formedness check in XmlTextReader and
	XmlNodeWriter was implemented, in relation to managed XSLT
	(Atsushi).

<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>C14N support has finally been added to System.Security
	assembly thanks to Aleksey Sanin!

	<p>Added missing classes/methods to System.Security,
	System.Security.Permissions, System.Security.Policies and
	System.Security.Principal. We now have a much better signature
	compatibility with the framework. [Duncan, Sebastien]

	<P>New unit tests in System.Security.Permissions,
	System.Security.Policies and
	System.Security.Principal. (Sebastien)

	<p>All (known) bugs are fixed in CryptoStream. (Sebastien)

	<p>MonoTODO attributes under System.Security.* have been updated
	and should reflect reality. (Sebastien)
	
<h3>Remoting</h3>

	<p>Improvements in Remoting infrastucture. Now it can run <a
	href="http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/">Remoting.Corba</a>
	out of the box. Both client and server channels work.

	<p>Implemented HttpChannel, thanks to the work of Hussein
	Mehanna, Ahmad Tantawy and Ahmad Kadry.

<h3>JScript</h3>

	<p>Progress from Cesar:

	<p>Parser: Support for classes, enumerations, interfaces, packages. 

	<p>Code Generation: "Hello mono::" is back. (first jscript .net
	program compiled by mjs).

	<p>Public API: The stubs for the classes of the Microsoft.JScript
	namespace public API are complete now. 

	<p>CodeGeneration and Semantic Analysis were supposed to be
	implemented as Visitor classed, that will change. The methods
	Resolve () and Emit () will be at each AST class.

<h3>System.Design and CodeDom</h3>

	<p>Andreas contributed a VB CodeDom provider and also implemented
	plenty of functionality System.Design and also fixed roughly a
	thousand API entry points in the API.

<h3>Mono Cairo debuts</h3>

	<p>Duncan has done <a
	href="http://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> bindings for
	Mono.  

	<p>In the next release we will drop our support for the old Xr
	bindings, and move everything to the new Cairo API.
