<h1>Mono 1.1.1 Development Release</h1>

	<p>Mono 1.1.1 is the first release on the development series
	of Mono and it is not intended to be used for production as it
	is undergoing internal changes.  Those interested in a
	production release should use the Mono 1.0.xx series.

	<p>The Mono 1.1.xx series will eventually lead to the next
	stable milestone: Mono 1.2.

	<p><b>Important:</b> Mono 1.1.1 can not be installed in
	parallel with Mono 1.0.x series on the same prefix.  To work
	around this issue, you must use a different prefix at
	configure time, for example:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ ./configure --prefix=/devel
	</pre>

	<p>You can then setup your PATH to include /devel/bin to
	access the Mono 1.1.  Alternatively you can replace your Mono
	installation with 1.1.1.

<h2>Changes since the Mono 1.0 release</h2>

	<p>The following is a high-level description of the changes in
	the development release of Mono since the original Mono 1.0 release.

<h3>Mono Ports</h3>

	<p>The Mono JIT has been ported to two new architectures, and
	another port has reached completion stage.

	<p>The engine is now 64-bit ready: the two new ports ports are
	64-bit ports.  Existing applications will automatically take
	advantage of the larger address space on these systems.
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>AMD64:</b> A 64 bit port done by Zoltan.
	
		<li><b>SPARC v9:</b> Another 64 bit port done by
		Zoltan.

		<li><b>S390:</b> Neale has declared that the port is
		now complete on the 1.1.1 branch.
	</ul>

	<p>Neale has also started a 64 bit port to the S390x
	architecture, the code is included but it is not ready yet.

<h3>Runtime</h3>

	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Runtime detection:</b> Implemented support for
		side-by-side execution of applications that require
		different runtime versions. Mono now will detect the
		runtime version that an application requires (checking
		the version number embedded in the assembly, or
		looking at the application configuraion file if
		available), and will load the appropiate mscorlib.dll
		and machine.config. Thanks to this feature it is much
		easier to test the new 2.0 libraries: an application
		compiled with gmcs will be automatically executed in a
		2.0 environment (Lluis).

		<li><b>ABC Elimination:</b> A new, more complete and
		more efficient implementation of the Array Bounds
		Check Elimination has been checked in.  Use the
		-O=abcrem command line option to enable it.

		<li><b>KQueue support:</b> KeventWatcher is a new
		FileSystemWatcher backend for *BSD systems that will
		default over the ManagedWatcher.  The implementation
		of this watcher gives significant performance gains
		over the Managed watch in any place that a
		FileSystemWatcher is used (ie; xsp/mod_mono).
	</ul>


<h3>Optimizations</h3>

	<p>Plenty of optimizations have been implemented at every
	level: from low-level JIT optimizations to tuning and stress
	testing the higher class libraries.  For example, the C# compiler in the
	1.1.x series is 20% faster over the 1.0.x series while doing
	more work.

	<p>Some details:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Reduced GC roots:</b> C static variables are no
		longer GC roots. This greatly reduces the overhead of
		garbage collection. It also reduces the false
		retention of GC objects. This gave a few percent
		improvement on MCS bootstrap. Also, it is a step
		towards a precise GC. (Ben)

		<li><b>Fast path for GC:</b> It now uses the thread
		local cache, many allocations now can go through a
		fast path (Ben).

		<li><b>Static Mono:</b> Mono is now statically linked,
		allowing the use of the special __thread compiler
		directive in more places (Zoltan).

		<li><b>XSP:</b> Performance of XSP has gone from 70
		requests per second to 170 (and 220 for .ashx files.  Also XSP
		is no longer slower than Apache+mod_mono, it is now slightly
		faster (Ben, Gonzalo)

		<li><b>XML:</b> The DOM and XmlTextWriter performance
		has also been improved (Atsushi).

		<li><b>C# Compiler:</b> Ben solved a long-standing
		optimization shortcoming in the compiler, now we
		generate optimal code for ++ and -- operators. 
	</ul>

	<p>Atsushi, Ben, Dick, Gonzalo, Paolo and Zoltan contributed
	to many other tuneups.
	
<h3>Web Services</h3>

	<p>There are many improvements and bug fixes to the existing
	core, in addition work has started on features from the .NET
	2.0 stack:
	
	<ul>
	
		<li><b>WSDL improvements:</b> New wsdl tool for the
		2.x framwework, and a new option: <tt>-server</tt> to
		support genreation of server-side skeletons in
		addition to client-side stubs (Lluis)

		<li><b>Unknown headers:</b> Unknown headers are now
		supported (<tt>SoapUnknownHeader</tt>) (LLuis).

		<li><b>WS-I:</b> WS-I Basic Profile 1.0 checker, not
		completed (Lluis).
	</ul>

	<p>In addition there is a new model for asynchronous calls and
	a the new tool `sgen' to pre-generate serializers debuts, but
	is still under development.

<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>Work on Code Access Security (CAS) from Sebastien
	has started:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Evidences are now provided for AppDomains and assemblies.
	
		<li><b>System.Security.Permissions:</b> is complete
		(in mscorlib.dll).  Most other permissions, in other assemblies, are also complete.

	
		<li><b>System.Security.Policy:</b> is mostly complete and
		basic security policies are supported.
		
		<li><b>Imperative demands:</b> are now supported.
		Declarative (attributes) are not yet supported.
		Neither are Assert, Deny and PermitOnly.

		<li><b>Samples:</b> MSDN library samples for
		permissions and policies classes are now working.

	</ul>

	<p>SHA224 has been added to the Mono.Security assembly. The
	certmgr tool is now able to manage the machine's store certificates in
	addition to the user certificates.

	<p>monodis now support declarative security attributes in it's IL output.


<h3>C# language updates</h3>

	<p>We continue to ship two compilers: mcs and gmcs.  The only
	difference between those compilers is that the latter has
	support for generics, but they share the rest of the features.

	<ul>
		<li><b>Static Classes:</b> C# 2.0 feature, added by
		Marek.

		<li><b>Partial Types:</b> C# 2.0 feature, added by
		Martin.

		<li><b>#pragma warning:</b> C# 2.0 feature, added by
		Marek.
	</ul>

	<p>We continue to improve the compiler to flag more errors for
	incorrect constructs or provide more useful information to the
	developer.   

	<p>On this new release of the compiler, we have made the
	warning level default to 4 from the regular 3.

<h3>Postgress: Npgsql</h3>

	<p>This update comes from Francisco: Added support for point,
	box, lseg, path, polygon and
	circle datatypes.  Added NpgsqlDbType enumeration with all
	supported types.

	<p>They are mapped to NpgsqlPoint, NpgsqlBox, NpgsqlLSeg,
	NpgsqlPolygon and NpgsqlCircle respectively. Thanks Glen
	Parker for help.

	<p>The following bugs have been fixed:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Added api documentation in code. Thanks Glen Parker. (No html generation 
	yet. This will be fixed in next release)
	
	<li>Fixed deserialization of NpgsqlException. There are some issues yet, 
	just the base message is being deserialized. Errors collection are null. 
	Thanks David Palmer (David dot Palmer at SensusTech dot com) for the 
	heads up and fix.
	
	<li>Improved Unicode encoding support. It was possible to characters in 
	unicode cross the stream buffer and be discarded. Now we use Decoders 
	which handle that situation. Thanks Oskars Ozols (oskars dot ozols at di 
	dot lv)
	
	<li>Improved connection startup code. Now new connections in ms.net goes a 
	lot faster. Thanks Mikko Korkalo (mikko.korkalo at f-solutions dot net) 
	for the patch.
	
	<li>Fixed a problem with plan execution in 7.3 backend versions. The text 
	parameters weren't being quoted and backend complained about that.
	
	<li>gborg 898: Added HasRows method to NpgsqlDataReader. Thanks keitsi at 
	minttupuffet dot net for feature request.
	
	<li>gborg 899: Fixed return of IsClosed after closing NpgsqlDataReader. 
	Thanks Mikko Korkalo (mikko.korkalo at f-solutions dot net) for the patch.
	
	<li>gborg 952: Added missing handling of NoData message.
	</ul>

<h3>System.XML</h3>


	<p>System.XML 2.0 development has started. Most of the new
	classes are checked in. They are mostly based on .NET FX 2.0
	beta 1. There are many "partly implemented and untested" new
	2.0 stuff:

	<ul>
		<li><b>XmlReader:</b> factory methods, some of the
		typed value supports, new helper methods such as
		MoveToDescendant(), ReadSubtree(),
		IXmlNamespaceResolver support.
		  
		<li><b>XML Schema:</b> XmlSchemaSet and new primitive
		types.
	
		<li><b>XPath:</b> XPathEditableNavigator and
		XPathDocument (it will be deprecated though), new
		navigation helper methods on XPathNavigator,
		XPathAtomicValue (too incomplete).
		  
		<li><b>XQuery:</b> It is based on the latest W3C
		working draft and many of the XQuery expressions are
		implemented as well as the early FLWOR support.
		Operations on sequence types are not
		supported. Functions won't work enough.  It is still
		highly unstable.
	</ul>
	
	<p>This work was done by Atsushi.

<h3>Basic Compiler</h3>

	<p>Anirban, Bernie, Jambunathan and Rafael have been making great
	progress on the Basic compiler, at this point it is possible
	to run ASP.NET applications, but work continues to refine the
	compiler.

	<p>Unlike the C# case where we had a large body of code to
	test against (the compiler, and later our class libraries),
	there is less Visual Basic code to test against, so we depend
	more on language tests for it, Sachin has been contributing to
	this area.

	<p>Since the last release, the mbas compiler supports:
	interfaces, inheritance definition, event handlers, implements
	clause, cross-assembly compilation, properties, enumerations,
	conditional compilation directives.

	<p>Jochen Wezel provided quick feedback on the changes and
	Rob Tillie helped with the VisualBasic.dll runtime.
	
<h3>C5 Class Library</h3>

	<p>We now distribute the C5 generics library created by Peter
	Sestoft and Niels Jørgen.  This library is currently used
	mostly as large test case for the Generics edition of the C#
	compiler as it is the largest body of template code for C#
	available to this date.

	<p>We want to thank Peter and Niels for making their work
	available under the MIT X11 license.

	<p>For more details about it, see the <a
	href="http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/">C5 home page.</a>

<h3>System.Drawing</h3>

	<p>Sanjay added support for multiple frames (gif and tiff) and
	graphic control extension (gif).  Animation along with
	reduction in size of gif files saved.

<h3>ADO.NET</h3>

	<p>Suresh and Uma continued to fix the existing 1-0 API and
	also have started on the 2.x API features:

<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>A new implementation of Windows.Forms is in progress.  This
	new implementation is a completely managed implementation and
	only uses a thin driver for interfacing with the host
	windowing system.  Two drivers are currently supported: Win32
	and X11, volunteers are welcome to implement a driver for
	Mac's CoreGraphics.

	<p>This team is currently composed of Jackson, Jordi, Peter
	and Ravindra who are working exclusively on it.
	
	<p>Although the souce code is part of the distribution, no
	binaries of the library can be distributed yet as it is not
	complete enough to provide the APIs that other parts of the
	class libraries require (this is only a build time issue for
	us, it will be addressed in an upcoming version of the 1.1.x
	series).

	<p>If you are interested in trying out the new version of
	Windows.Forms, you should download the mcs package, configure,
	and then do:

	<pre class="shell">
	
	$ cd mcs-1.1.1
	$ ./configure --prefix=/YOURPREFIX
	$ cd mcs/class/Managed.Windows.Forms
	$ make clean
	$ make install
	</pre>

	<p>Notice that this is not complete, and it is not finished,
	contributors are welcome.  To discuss this, please join the <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">mono-winforms-list</a>

	<p>For details on how to contribute, see Peter's <a

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

	<p>The parser and lexer of Java Script have been rewritten by
	Cesar by porting the code from Rhino.  

<h3>General .NET 2.x updates</h3>

	<p>Tim Coleman, Sebastien Poulliot, Carlos Alberto, [FIXME:
	FULL LIST]
	
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

	<p>All the bug fixes from the 1.0.x release are available on
	the development version of Mono as well.
