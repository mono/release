<h1>Mono 0.29, MonoDoc 0.8, XSP 0.8 and mod_mono 0.6</h1>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>

	<p>A new release of <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a> has been released.
	Mono is an open source implementation of the .NET Framework
	for Unix, Linux and Windows systems.

	<p>There are big breaking news: Mono JIT on PowerPC runs Hello
	World, ASP.NET is feature complete, AppDomain unloading is
	supported and 64-bit ports of HPPA and SPARCv9 are available
	now.  A new group of developers from Mainsoft has been
	contributing extensively to ADO.NET and ASP.NET.

	<p>This release includes four components at once: the Runtime
	and Software Development Kit as well as the Documentation
	browser, our XSP web host for ASP.NET and the Mono/Apache
	module have been released.  Packages for various distributions
	are also available from our download page.</p>

	<p>A big push in this release has been to get closer to
	completion on the .NET 1.0 and .NET 1.1 APIs and completing
	pieces that we need for the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-roadmap.html">Mono 1.0
	release</a>.  But at the same time work continues within the
	safety of #ifdefs on Mono 1.1 features (integrating .NET 1.2
	components).
	
	<p>I know that the following summary is incomplete, I
	apologize for missing major features</p>

	<h3>Stats</h3>

	<p>Since the last release, 3,071 individual commits were done to
	our runtime and class libraries.</p>

	<p>310 bugzilla bugs were closed.</p>

	<h3>Thanks</h3>

	<p>A big thank you goes for Duncan Mak who worked steadily to
	get every new dependency of Mono compiled and tested in four
	platforms as well as maintaining the Red Carpet channel (and
	soon, give us the easy installer).

<h2>1. Availability</h2>
	
	<p><b>Binary Packages:</b>

	<blockquote>
	<p>Pre-compiled packages for various platforms are available
        from our web site from the <a
        href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">download</a>
        section:

	<ul> <a
        href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</a>
	</ul>

	<p>Since there are so many new package dependencies (libicu
	and the Cairo universe), we are not listing the individual
	packages to download anymore and we recommend that you use Red
	Carpet to install.

	<p>The Ximian Desktop installer will be able to install Mono
	later this week, so with a single click, you should be able to
	install Mono 0.29 on your system.

	 <p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>

	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	source code is very simple:

$ cd mono-0.29
$ ./configure
$ make install</pre>
	 
	 </blockquote>

<h2>2. Mono Runtime Changes.</h2>

	<p>Fedora's security features broke Mono 0.28, this version of
	Mono rectifies this problem.
	
	
<h3>Ahead of Time Compiler</h3>

	<p>Bug fixes in the C# compiler now permit all the assemblies
	to be pre-compiled using the ahead-of-time compilation option
	of Mono.  On average a fully AOT environment will give the C#
	compiler a 20% performance boost.

<h3>Porting Progress</h3>

	<p>More work on the PowerPC code generator is on this release,
	the JIT engine was able to run "Hello World" for the first
	time.  This involves JITing a fair amount of code, roughly
	about 100 methods and it also exercises various P/Invoke and
	calling convention features.  (<a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/images/mono-macosx.png">[Screenshot]</a>)

	<p>At this point it seems like Mono exposes a few bugs on
	the MacOS X application support.
	
	<p>64-bit support for the VM was checked in for the SPARC v9
	and HPPA architectures by Bernie Solomon.   This is a
	significant change because this means that the values of the 
	"IntPtr" variable is 8-bytes instead of 4-bytes.  The port
	included various cleanups in our libraries to make them 64-bit
	ready. 

<h3>Internationalization</h3>

	<p>Dick has checked in a large upgrade to our
	internationalization support, initially this code contains
	CultureInfo and string collation routines.  This uses IBM's
	IBM's ICU library, available from:<br> <a
	href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/index.html">http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/index.html</a>.

	<p>Now Mono can cope with charset-encoded filenames instead of
	demanding them to be in UTF-8 format.  See the man page for
	mono(1) for details.

<h3>Generics Support</h3>

	<p>Martin continues his work to support generics in Mono.  The
	support is not ready for prime time yet, but you can see some
	thirty-something generic sample programs in mcs/tests/gen-*

<h3>Improved Trace Facility</h3>

	<p>The runtime features an improved trace facility, developers
	can now include and exclude groups of methods, namespaces,
	types and assemblies from the trace output, a helpful tool for
	debugging code.  See the man page for details.

	<p>For example, to trace method calls in the program, and on
	the System.XML namespace, use:
	
	<pre class="shell">
$ mono --trace=program,N:System.Xml hello.exe
</pre>
	

<h3>AppDomain unloading and Module support</h3>

	<p>Mono has finally gained module support, some programs from
	the Mercury compiler are known to work now and this should
	allow the IIOP.NET folks to continue their work	(Zoltan).

	<p>AppDomains can now be unloaded (Zoltan).

<h3>Other runtime features</h3>

	<p>Gonzalo and Zoltan have fixed a long-standing problem with
	the implementation of Equals on ValueTypes, this problem was
	not only fixed by Gonzalo, but later the performance was
	boosted by Zoltan.

	<p>Lluis implemented context static field support for remoting.

	<p>Zoltan implemented AppDomain unloading, LastErr flag on
	P/Invoke methods, stdcall calling conventions support,
	marshalling of structs and improved the support for running
	SML.NET and Mercury.NET generated code.

	<p>AppDomain.LoadAssemblyRaw functionality has been added by
	Zdravko Tashev.
	
<h2>3. Compilers and Tools Changes.</h2>

	<p>The C# compiler continues to be bug fixed.  A new version
	of the compiler `gmcs' is available for testing out the
	Generics features of C# 2.0.  To use this feature, you must
	rebuild the Mono class libraries with the `generics' profile:

	<pre class="shell">
$ cd mcs-0.29
$ make PROFILE=generics
$ make install</pre>

	<p>Sebastien and Zoltan improved MCS to support delay-signing
	of assemblies.   Also the <tt>sn</tt> (StrongName) tool is
	included in this distribution to re-sign and verify signatures
	of assemblies.
	
<h2>4. Mono Class Libraries Changes.</h2>

<h3>Corlib has been renamed to Mscorlib</h3>

	<p>We have finally renamed `corlib.dll' into `mscorlib.dll'
	which means that we removed all the various workarounds that
	we had in the code to cope with this difference. 

<h3>Novell.Directory.LDAP</h3>

	<p>Sunil Kumar and his team at Novell have contributed a fully
	managed implementation of LDAP for Mono and the .NET
	Framework.   The code is now part of the standard distribution
	of Mono, and is being used to implement our
	System.DirectoryServices namespace.   The Mono.Directory.LDAP
	assembly is now deprecated in favor of this.

<h3>System.Drawing and Windows.Forms</h3>

	<p>In the last release of Mono we had started an effort to
	unify the three backends that we had for System.Drawing, since
	it was becoming hard to maintain.

	<p>The new strategy to implement System.Drawing is to use the
	GDI+ API on Unix and implement the GDI+ C Flat API on top of
	the cairo library (which is now a dependency).

	<p>The good news is that the code is much simpler, our support
	is more complete, and we can develop this one faster.  The bad
	news is that there are many regressions on this release
	related to using System.Drawing and Windows.Forms on Unix.

	<p>Windows.Forms in this release is broken on Unix, but fairly
	functional on Windows.  The new rendering engine introduced
	for System.Drawing broke a lot of the functionality we had,
	and we will be working hard to address those limitations on
	the next release. 

<h3>Databases</h3>

	<p>Reggie updates the ByteFX MySQL provider on CVS and
	Francisco updates the Npgsql provider, so this version ships
	with the latest editions of these two providers.

	<p>Victor contributed an updated DB2 provider.   We could not
	get the latest version of his code before the release, but
	expect the namespace to change on the next release as we
	become binary compatible with the IBM.Data.Db2Client
	implementation.

	<p>Eran Domb has been actively fixing bugs in the System.Data
	assembly and related tools.

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

	<p>Cesar continued with the grammar fixes to the language.  Code
	Generation for: default ms compiler jscript assembly format,
	function declarations, variable declarations, boolean literals,
	string literals and initial code generation for binary
	operations.
	
	<p>Semantic Analysis: initial /fast features, like detecting
	not declared variables.
	
<h2>5. Web Services and Remoting Changes</h2>

	<p>Lluis has been working hard on completing the Web Services
	and Remoting assemblies to reach 1.0.

	<p>All the encodings are now supported (previously we
	supported only document/literal): literal encoded and RPC
	format is now supported, with wrapped or bare parameters.

	<p>A new documentation page is generated now for web services
	automatically and added support for generation of WSDL files
	for client HttpPost and HttpGet.

	<p>Web Services error handling and error reporting has
	improved a lot as we started using it for developing our own
	web services and the various improvements to the HTTP runtime
	also benefit this space.  The discovery classes have been
	added to support the DISCO protocol, and a new tool (disco) is
	distributed as well.

	<p>Remoting.Configuration has been implemented thanks to Jaime
	who did the first pass at the implementation and Lluis who
	completed it and deployed it.  Remoting objects can be hosted
	in XSP, the .rem and .soap files types are now supported as well.

	<p>Improved the performance of calls between application
	domains, and also implemented support for asynchronous calls
	as well as improving the support for synchronization and
	static fields.

<h3>WSE: The Web Services Enhancements</h3>

	<p>Sebastien added support for trace filters on input/output
	SOAP messages.

	<p>He also added support for WS-Security on the client side:
	UserName rountrip (except digital signatures) and XML
	encryption using X.509 certificates to/from a web service.

<h2>6. Mono Documentation Browser Changes.</h2>

	<p>MonoDoc is the Mono Documentation Browser.  It includes
	class library documentation, tutorials, the C# language
	reference and errors reference.  Monodoc contains inline
	editing and collaboration facilities built into it. 
	
	<p>On this release of MonoDoc we are shipping with its
	collaboration features turned on.  Users can now edit the
	content for the class library documentation and submit their
	improvements through a Mono Web Service.  Improvements will
	appear on upcoming releases of MonoDoc.

	<p>The editing facility in MonoDoc contains new shortcuts to
	insert cross references, tables, item lists and code samples
	(miguel).  Also Ben added support for editing enumeration
	definitions (<a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/images/Screenshot-MonodocEditing.png">[Screenshot]</a>).

	<p>The Web edition has better JavaScript navigation facilities
	for the tree explorer, and Gonzalo improved the caching of
	data for the web edition of Monodoc: now it will return the
	time-stamp of the documents to avoid reloading redundant
	information over the web.

	<p>You can use the Monodoc/web edition to host the
	documentation for your own class libraries.

	<p>You can see the web front-end for Monodoc live at <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.html">http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.html</a>

	<p>John Luke contributed various aesthetic changes to the web
	edition and various Gtk# types were documented by him.  The
	new style is closer to the NDoc web interface.

	<p>New documentation for NUnit, Npgsql is also available.

	<p><b>Monkeyguide</b>: We are shipping the Monkeyguide in this
	release, but we need help in updating it as well as doing
	editing work on it.  It is known to contain old materials that
	confuse people, if you are interested in helping the
	documentation effort, please subscribe to the
	mono-docs-list@ximian.com mailing list. 

<h2>7. ASP.NET: Feature complete</h2>

	<p>Two major changes in this release: OutputCache support and
	state session support.   With this we consider our
	implementation of ASP.NET to be feature complete, and at this
	point we are requesting ASP.NET developers to try out their
	existing applications and report any problems to us (Please use <a
	href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com">Bugzilla</a> to file a
	report). 
	
	<p><b>In depth</b>: Now Mono supports the session managers other than the
	in-memory session manager.  There are two: the StateServer and
	the SQL-based state server.  Both configured the same way you
	would on Microsoft.NET.

	<p>The Mono SQLSessionServer allows you to use any database
	provider that implements the IDbConnection interface (The
	default provider is Npgsql).

	<p> A little extra configuration is required because of this
	extra flexibility. If you are not using Npgsql you need to add
	the StateDBProviderAssembly and StateDBConnectionType
	attributes to your app settings like so:

<xmp class="code-xml">
<appSettings>
	<add key="StateDBProviderAssembly" value="Npgsql"/>
	<add key="StateDBConnectionType" value="Npgsql.NpgsqlConnection"/>
</appSettings>
</xmp>

	<p><a
	href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/cpconOutputCache.asp">OutputCache</a>
	is supported now on ASP.NET pages.

	<p>Two new tools asp_state.exe and dbsessmgr.exe ship: the
	first is the state manager for ASP.NET and the later is a tool
	to manipulate the current session database.

	<p>Support for other languages in ASP.NET is included now,
	they only need to distribute a CodeDOM provider (VB.NET does).

	<p>Support for different character set encodings on files,
	requests and responses instead of only supporting UTF-8.

	<p>Timeouts: now it is possible to use the machine.config or
	the application config file to control the amount of time that
	the runtime will wait to process an ASP.NET request.  If the
	timeout is exceeded the operation is aborted.

	<p>A request queue mechanism: it now possible to inform the
	runtime through the machine.config or application config file
	how many threads it should consume from the threadpool: any
	excess requests will be queued up instead of consuming all the
	threads available:

	<xmp class="code-xml"><system.web>
	<httpRuntime executionTimeout="90"
		maxRequestLength="4096"
		useFullyQualifiedRedirectUrl="false"
		minFreeThreads="8"
		minLocalRequestFreeThreads="4"
		appRequestQueueLimit="100" />
</system.web>
	</xmp>

	<p>Alon and Yaron from Mainsoft have actively contributed to
	fixing plenty of bugs and controls on this release.

<h2>8. Security</h2>

	<p>The Mono Cryptographic libraries are very complete and all
	written in managed code.  Various people take bits and pieces
	of it and run it on smaller devices where the Compact
	Framework might not have all the functionality they need.

	<p>In this release Sebastien expands the Mono.Security code
	base with new features:

	<ul>
	<li>Augmented support for X.509 certificates.
	<li>Basic chaining and trust-anchors.
	<li>Added a managed MD4 implementation to support NTLM
	authentication.
	<li>Added PKCS#8 support to protect private keys - required
	for PKCS #12.
	</ul>

	<p>You can track Sebastien's <a
	href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">blog</a> for
	more up-to-date information on security.
	
	
<h2>9. Support for .NET 1.2</h2>

	<p>Some work has begun in various areas to support the .NET
	1.2 APIs, although Mono 1.0 will not ship with support for 1.2
	APIs, some work is being done to get a head start.

<h3>Runtime features</h3>

	<p>Martin continued his work on the runtime features to
	support generics and Zoltan brought in some of the new features
	from .NET 1.2 to System.Reflection: Dynamic methods and the
	new Reflection.Emit support for things like type modifiers. 

<h3>ObjectSpaces</h3>

	<p>Implementation on ObjectSpaces has begun: Mark Easton,
	Richard Thombs and Tim Coleman have started work on this new
	database system.  

	<p>The current strategy has been to stub out code to get the
	basics moving, and write unit tests as we go.
	
<h3>Crypto</h3>

	<p>Most of the new cryptographic functionality available in .NET
	1.2 was already part of Mono.Security or were internal classes
	of System.Security.

	<p>Pieter Philippaerts donated this RIPEMD160 managed hash
	implementation.

	<p>Added the new classes for the new HMAC and it's
	derived companions: HMACMD5,HMACRIPEMD160, HMACSHA256,
	HMACSHA384 and HMACSHA512 (Sebastien).

	<p>Added the new PKCS#5 PBDKF2 password based key derivation
	inRfc2898DeriveBytes (Sebastien).

	<p>Also new:
	
	<ul>
	<li>System.Security.Cryptography: Complete support for ASN1
	data and OID.
	<li>System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs: Started implemention
	usingMono.Security PKCS#7 support.
	<li>System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates: Started
	implementation using Mono.Security X.509 support.
	</ul>

<h2>10. Other News</h2>

	<p>Gonzalo has written a couple of new tools to generate an
	XML map of an API and a tool to compare arbitrary sets of XML
	API maps.  We are now using this in place of our previous
	"CorCompare" tool to generate the API status pages on the Mono
	site.  The new tools allow us to update those more frequently
	and they more accurately represent the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/class-status-corlib.html">current library
	status</a>. 

	<p>Our IL assembler and disassembler are much better and more
	conforming than before.
