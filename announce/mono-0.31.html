	<h3>Thanks</h3>

	<p>A big thank goes again for Duncan Mak who worked steadily to
	get every new dependency of Mono compiled and tested on our
	Linux Platforms.   Duncan has a mid-term exam tomorrow, if you
	are a package user, send him a nice email (duncan@ximian.com).

<h2>Availability</h2>

	 <p><b>Ports:</b>
	 <blockquote>
	 <p>Ports of popular open source applications are now
	maintained here: <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/ports/">http://www.go-mono.com/ports/</a>.
	 </blockquote>
	
	 <p><b>Dependencies</b>

	 <p>If you are installing from source code, there are a few
	 optional dependencies that you will want to consider
	 installing.

	 <blockquote>
	 <p><b>icu 2.6.1</b> Required for supporting international
	 information.  Strongly recommended.

	 <p><b>libgdiplus 0.2</b> Required if you want to use
	 System.Drawing APIs.

	 <p><b>Cairo 0.1.18</b> Required to install libgdiplus.
	 
	 </blockquote>

	 <p><b>Quick source code installation:</b>

	 <blockquote>
	 <p>If we have no packages for your platform, installing from
	source code is very simple (MacOS X users, read the rest of
	the notes):

	<p>mono:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf mono-0.31.tar.gz
    $ cd mono-0.31
    $ ./configure
    $ make install
	
</pre>

	</blockquote>

	<p><b>Optional Packages</b><p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Libgdiplus and WineLib are optional packages, you only need
	those if you intent to use System.Drawing and Windows.Forms
	respectively.
	
	<p>libgdiplus:</p>
	
	<pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf libgdiplus-0.2.tar.gz
    $ cd libgdiplus-0.2
    $ ./configure
    $ make install
	
</pre>

	<p>For WineLib, it is necessary first to install a Wine
	 package from <a href="http://www.winehq.com">Wine HQ</a>, and
	 once that is installed, you can install the WineLib package,
	 which is now just an extension to Wine instead of a
	 modification to Wine:

	 <pre class="shell">
	
    $ tar xzf winelib-0.1.tar.gz
    $ cd winelib-0.1.tar.gz
    $ ./configure
    $ make install
	
</pre>

	 </blockquote>

<h2>Windows.Forms update</h2>

	<p>The major achievement in this release is that both
	System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms have been improved to
	the point where it is possible to use Windows.Forms in Mono
	again.  Peter Bartok came up with a wonderful approach to use
	Wine: now we use a very small program that allows us to use
	the system Wine.  Thanks to Alexandre Julliard for the help in
	getting this wine "loader" ready.

	<p>Windows.Forms applications now work again, but they are not
	complete.  Work is underway to complete them, and now that we
	have a stable foundation, we would appreciate if volunteers
	assisted us in completing various controls.

	<p>Windows.Forms will not be officially supported for the Mono
	1.0 release (but it will be available under the `if it breaks,
	you get to keep both pieces' agreement).  Windows.Forms will
	be supported in the the Mono 1.2 release.

	<p>But those interested in trying it out should: install Wine,
	winelib-0.1, libgdiplus-0.2 and they can try some of their
	applications.  This is still an early preview, but some
	applications and tests are up and running again.
	
<h2>Performance</h2>

	<p>Gonzalo did some fixes in the Socket class: It now uses the
	threadpool for asynchronous IO.

	<p>He also improved the threadpool: it now recycles
	WaitHandles and creates them on demand.

	<p>Andreas and Jackson re-implemented the various methods in
	the `Char' class to use managed code which greatly accelerates
	all of these routines, by avoiding the managed to unmanaged
	transition.

<h2>PowerPC port <img src="http://www.go-mono.com/images/mono-exclusive.gif"></h2>

	<p>A big change to support thunks was checked by Paolo in to
	the code generator so we can support large applications (above
	the 64 MB direct jump limit on PPC).

	<p>Exceptions are now partially working on the JIT: if thrown
	from managed code they work, but still fail when raised from
	within the runtime engine, and in MacOS X we will need some
	extra work to catch the equivalent to SIGSEGV, so instead of a
	NullReferenceException you will get a crash with the JIT
	today.

	<p>MacOS X users: you will need to obtain the latest
	development of the Boehm GC
	http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/ as the
	bundled edition of the GC wont work on MacOS X.

	<p>To use you must configure with --with-gc=boehm instead of
	the default which is --with-gc=included.

	<p>Debug symbols work on PPC now from Urs.

<h2>SPARC Port <img src="http://www.go-mono.com/images/mono-exclusive.gif"></h2>

	<p>All of the regression tests that pass on the x86 port of
	Mono work on the Solaris port.  Although it is on par
	feature-wise with the x86 edition and can complete a complete
	bootstrap of Mono, it has not yet been tuned for performance
	like the x86 version has.

	<p>The SPARC port of Mono was done by Zoltan Varga in a record
	time of little more than a month of work. 

<h2>Interpreter: AMD64 support</h2>

	<p>Zalman Stern contributed support for running the Mono
	interpreter on AMD64.  It is a port on its early stages.
	
<h2>C# Compiler</h2>

	<p>Many bugs have been fixed and work on performance has
	continued in the compiler.  

	<p>But our major focus has been on adding 2.0 features in a
	couple of separate branches (anonymous methods and generics).
	
<h2>JScript</h2>

	<p>JScript keeps advancing slowly, Cesar has implemented the
	If and Print statements as well as the Comma operator.
	
<h2>Mono Runtime Changes.</h2>

	<p>Sebastien implemented Principal support in AppDomain and
	Thread class. You can now use imperative Role Based Access
	Control (RBAC) with Mono.

	<p>Many bug fixes continue to be applied to the runtime, many
	improvements
	
<h2>Async IO support, FileSystemWatcher</h2>

	<p>Gonzalo added support for Async IO to our IO stack as well
	as the FileSystemWatcher API.

	<p>If your system supports the POSIX aio_ interface, the
	FileStream will be able to take advantage of it when the
	programmer requests asynchronous operations.  In the past Mono
	would use threads from the threadpool to implement this
	functionality.

	<p>FileSystemWatcher can take advantage of <a
	href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/">FAM</a> on sysstems
	that support it, on other systems the feature is emulated
	using polling plus a separate thread.

<h2>Cryptography</h2>

	<p>Sebastien has documented his saga in improving the
	CryptoStream: it took several rewrites until he got all of the
	samples out there on the network to work, and we are very
	happy with the results.   Someone told me `It is not fun to
	debug this stream over Http, because all you get is encrypted
	buffers that are hard to decipher'.

	<p>He also implemented key pair persistance for RSA and DSA
	keys.  This is similar to the CryptoAPI containers.  Notice
	that in Linux there is no such things as a "secure storage"
	like there is in Windows, and the keys are stored in your
	~/.mono/keypairs directory.

	<p>
	<img src="http://www.go-mono.com/images/mono-exclusive.gif">
	
	<p>Updates to <b>Mono.Security.dll</b>:

	<ul>
	<li>
	SymmetricTransform is now available (no
	more hidden in corlib) in Mono.Security making it easier to
	support all cipher modes for newsymmetric block ciphers.

	<li>BigInteger and RSAManaged are now exposed in Mono.Security
	which permitted to include Diffie-Hellman (PKCS#3) support
	(contributed by Pieter Philippaerts).

	<li>Basic certificate store implementation for storing trusted
	root certificates.
	</ul>
	
<h2>SSL and HTTPS</h2>

	<p>Sebastien has been working on TLS/SSL support using
	WebRequest/WebResponse including support for
	ICertificatePolicy while Carlos has been doing some serious
	refactoring for future (in-development) server-side TLS/SSL
	support.

	<p>SSL support requires:

	<ul>
	<li>Mono.Security.dll assembly (in the PATH on Windows).
	<li>That you trust the CA that emitted the SSL
	certificate (see certmgr.exe) or write your own policy.
	</ul>

<h2>Web Services</h2>

	<p>Improved our `wsdl' command line tool to use the Discovery
	classes, so it now can handle .disco files as well as .wsdl
	files.  Also Lluis added support for the missing command line
	options.

	<p>System.Web.Services.Discovery is now completely
	implemented. 

	<p>The web services stack now routinely processes 300 SOAP
	WSDL descriptions to ensure that no regressions are introduced
	into the codebase.

	<p>Web Services are the major user of the XmlSerializer, the
	XmlSerializer historically has used a table to drive the
	serialization process: the table is computed when you create
	your serializer, and serialization of objects is done by
	"interpreting" the table one step at a time.

	<p>Lluis has improved the serializer to compile the above
	serializer table into a C# program.  The generated program is
	then dynamically loaded into the program increasing the
	performance of serialization.  This feature is disabled by
	default, to enable it you must set the environment variable
	MONO_XMLSERIALIZER_THS to 0.

	<p><img src="http://www.go-mono.com/images/mono-exclusive.gif">
	
	<p>A full description on how to control this serializer
	feature see <a
	href="http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000376.html">Lluis
	description</a>.
	
	<p>Mainsoft has contributed also numerous bug fixes to this
	release.

<h2>ADO.NET</h2>

	<p>The Mainsoft folks (Alon Gazit, Eran Domb and Boris
	Kirzner) have redone chunks of our ADO.NET implementation to
	improve its performance in disconnected operation.

	<p>Added : indexes on tables are built at the time of
	constraints and relations adding in order to improve
	performance of actions that need to query tables for
	child/parent rows or check row column values uniqueness.

	<p>XmlDataReader. Reading DataSet from XML reviewed in order
	to support various scenarios (missing DataSet element etc).

	<p>We have reached completion in a number of classes, thanks
	to Uma who has been going through the code to complete these:
	System.Data.SqlTypes, many components of the SQL client types
	and ODBC.
	
<h2>XML land</h2>

	<p>Atsushi has been hard at optimizing the XmlReader and
	XmlWriter as well as the DOM and the Xslt engines.

	<p>
	<img src="http://www.go-mono.com/images/mono-exclusive.gif">

	<p><b>RelaxNG library:</b> - RelaxngValidatingReader
	has been improved. It now supports custom datatype. Now it
	validates XML Schema datatypes and default RELAX NG types by
	default. Several bugfixes to it have been done.

	<p>The library also contains a Compact Syntax parser.  You can
	read a compact syntax file, create a grammar object, and
	output it in the form of XML via its new writing methods.   To
	use it, you can use:

<xmp class="code-csharp">
RncParser parser = new RncParser (new NameTable ());
TextReader source = new StreamReader ("relaxng.rnc");
RelaxngGrammar grammar = parser.Parse (source);

return new RelaxngValidatingReader (
  new XmlTextReader ("anygrammar.rng"), grammar);
</xmp>	

	<p>For more details on it, see the <a href=
	"http://primates.ximian.com/~atsushi/blog/archives/000375.html">The
	Compact Syntax Parser</a> blog post from Atsushi.  

<h2>Networking stack</h2>

	<p>A lot of work went into the HttpWebRequest code, Gonzalo
	reports: 

	<ul>
		<li>Support for sending chunked data in
		HttpWebRequest.
		
		<li>Honor the protocol version received from the
		server.
		
		<li>Support preauthentication.

		<li>Proxy authentication.

		<li>Lots of fixes.
	</ul>

<h2>ASP.NET Web Forms</h2>

	<p>Gonzalo added support for session and application objects
	in Global.asax.

	<p>Fixed bug in Sys.Web.Configuration that caused a
	performance loss.
	
<h2>System.Drawing</h2>

	<p>The work continues to split the System.Drawing code into
	chunks that live in the managed world, and chunks implemented
	in C for the libgdiplus library which in turn uses Cairo to do
	all the heavy lifting.
	
	<p>Duncan continuted work on GDI+ and GraphicsPath is now
	almost complete.

	<p>Jordi Mas has completed the Font support (we use FreeType
	to render the glyphs) and has also been fixing and completing
	many parts here.

	<p>Ravindra Kumar has contributed many of the different
	brushes: texture, hatch 17 out of 52 styles and early gradient
	path brush that GDI+ supports.
	
<h2>Remoting</h2>

	<p>Lluis improves the binary formatter. It can now generate IL
	code on the fly to access the fields of objects, giving a x3
	performance boost in some cases.
	
	<p>Plenty of bug fixes, some fixes were related to changing
	some of the field names in our core classes to match the
	Microsoft .NET names, so we could become compatible with some
	of the over-the-wire message exchanges.

<h2>Npgsql: Postgres bindings.</h2>

	<p>Implemented support to specify max number of connections
	Npgsql can use for pooling. The default is 20. You can do that
	by using the construct MaxPoolSize=value in the connection
	string.
	
	<p>Also, a timeout construct was added to specify, in seconds,
	the maximum time Npgsql should wait for getting connections
	from the pool when there is no connections available. You can
	use it with Timeout=value in the connection string. Default
	value is 15.
	
	<p>Encodings used by Npgsql can now be specified in the
	connection string. Use the construct Encoding=value. Possible
	values currently supported are: UNICODE and SQL_ASCII. Default
	value is SQL_ASCII.

<h2>Tools</h2>

	<p><b>certmgr</b> to add/remove/list trusted root certificates
	(see man page).

	<p><b>setreg</b> to add/remove the (Mono and MS) test root
	certificates (used by makecert) from trusted certificates.

	<p><b>monop</b> A small little command-line tool from Ben
	Maurer that dumps a class definition to standard output,
	useful when programming if you do not remember a method name
	(a life saver when you do not remember if ArrayList has a
	Count or a Length ;-)
	
<h2>Generics and the C# compiler</h2>

	<p>At this point our generics compiler (gmcs) and runtime seem
	to be feature complete, Martin has been working steadily on
	the compiler front, and some bits of the Generic class
	libraries.

	<p>Our next tasks are to review the specification and make sure
	we flag every possible error as well as continuing the
	implementation of our generic class library.

	<p>Although Generics are available now as the <tt>gmcs</tt>
	compiler, they will not be part of the 1.0 release, the
	generic compiler is only present for those working on the post
	Mono 1.0 components. 

<h2>Databases: DB2</h2>

	<p>Victor Vatamanescu has contributed an updated DB2 database
	provider.  It works on both Windows and Linux and matches the
	API and functionality from the IBM developed provider.

	<p>See the <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/ibmdb2.html">http://www.go-mono.com/ibmdb2.html</a>
	for further details.

<h2>Consistency and completeness</h2>

	<p>A special recognition goes to Andreas Nahr who continued
	his task to complete various low-level bits on the class
	libraries (adding localization functions, implementing missing
	interfaces, proper error checking) as well as making our class
	libraries conform to the coding guidelines.

<h2>The people behind this release</h2>
